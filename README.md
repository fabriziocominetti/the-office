Repository containing multiple projects regarding NBC's mockumentary 'The Office'.

-- Project status: [Active]

## About & Motivation

I'm a fan of The Office and I wanted to use related data to dive deeper into the data science field and to experiment with some tools and technologies.

## Methods & Results

I started by scraping all the quotes from [this website](https://www.officequotes.net/), building in this way a dataframe and a csv file.

Next, I've computed some basic exploratory analysis with pandas and seaborn as well as a sentiment analysis with VADER and Power BI.
